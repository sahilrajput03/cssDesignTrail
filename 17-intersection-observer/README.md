Theory: They are basically events which we register which get fired when the target html element intersects with viewport boundary. ~ kevin

~ Sahil: Callback registered will be fired on page load if script (when used with `deffered`) and thereafter the cb will be triggered whenever the element(even small part of it) enters the view port OR the element gets removed **completely** from the the view port.
