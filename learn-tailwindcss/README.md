***Bcoz images are worth a thousand words!***

- **You can hover any classname in vscode to get the copiled css for any pseudo class like that:**

- **How group thing works?**

	*FYI: The `sidebar-tooltip` custom pseudo class has `scale-0` property which makes it hidden (size zero) by default. So on hovering the parent element ( i.e., having class `group`) will make the `sidebar-tooltip` element have `scale-100` i.e., expand to its full size.*
