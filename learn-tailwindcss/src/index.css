		Learn: Sahil: Try what atually scale property is interactively: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/scale */

		/* LEARN2:  We can't use hover over an invisible item so we can't use hover: class in above tooltip classes in there, but amazingly tailwindcss has a very good feature to help in such situations i.e., `group`. `group` is a clever way to apply classes to a child element when a parent's state changes (in our case we make use of hover state of parent)! Yikes!

		BUT IMPORATNT THIS TO NOTE, is that `group` doesn't work in `@appy` so instead we would need to apply such gorup classes in direct markup i.e, in our SideBar.js file.
		
		SO NOW SIMPLY GO TO SideBar.js file to see hove I have used `group` and `group-hover:scale-100` there! */
