************
=> BEGINNING OF FLEX
#Defining display: flex  is must for everything you want to do with flex.
.class1{
	display: flex;
	# flex-direction: row; (default)
	# OtherOptions:
	# flex-direction: row-reverse;
	# flex-direction: column-reverse;
	# flex-direction: column;
}
```

### `align-items` and `align-self`

Defines alignment in cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis). `align-items` is assigned to the cross bow itself, and `align-self` to children elements.

```txt
align-items: stretch; (default)
align-self: stretch; (default)

We can apply following properties to align-items and align-self:
center
flex-start
flex-end
baseline
^^ This is helpful if you have different font-size elements, and you want them to have their lower bottom of line aligned, just use this thing.

### `justify-content`

Defines alignment of children of flex in main axis.

```txt
flex-start (default)
flex-end
center
space-between
space-around (in this case space will be in the end of each sides too)
```

```txt
FLEX-GROW: 1;
*DEFAULT value of flex-grow is 0, i.e., items don't auto expand at all.
*flex-grow always has to be applied directly to the targets, not to the crossbow itself.
* Use this to auto children sizing according to space available.

* flex grow works in the expansion (in same axis as the flex-direction)

* If you want them to grow 1st element and 2nd element in proportion 1:2, then define individual `flex-grow` in each of those elements as 1 and 2 in the other one..

*If you want any element to not grow, set flex-grow:0 to that element.

//////////////
* flex-shrink works in the compression in the same axis as flex-direction.
flex-shrink: 1
* If you give flex-shrink (ITS ABOUT RATIOS ONLY) to all elements via a separate class to all the child of the flex with flex-shrink as 1 or 2 or 3 or anything else, its just same, yikes!(coz its after all rations that is assigned to every element.)

*LEARN: DEFAULT value of flex-shrink is 1.
*LEARN: Setting value to 2 will make that particular flex-item to shrink twice as other items coz other items have 1 as their value by default.
*LEARN: You can make a child to refuse to shrink via setting flex-shrink as 0.
*LEARN: The value other
Amazing demonstration @ https://youtu.be/o-dDFSH-BxM

//////////////
FLEX-BASIS (basically it overrides the width property, yikes!)
It is a new and improved version of css width property. e.g. usage: flex-basis: 300px;
*flex-basis is supposed to given to children of the flex, not the container itself.
Also, in below e.g.,
.goo{
    width: 500px;
    flex-basis: 100px;
    //here, flex-basis will win over width property.
}

* min-width acts as lower limit of flex-basis, yikes!(*NOTE : Only min-width is respected where a flex-basis has a lower value is already there.)
* max-width acts as upper limit of flex-basis, yikes!(*NOTE: Only max-width is respected where a flex-basis has a greater value is already there.)
*flex-basis isn't just for width. When shooting vertically(i.e., flex-direction is column or column-reverse) it(flex-basis) deals with height instead of width. In other words flex-basis changes the size of things in the direction of our lazer direction, yo!
*flex-basis can used to set percentage(of the total size of the container) to set its length, for e.g., `flex-basis: 50%; `.
*flex-basis's DEFAULT value is auto, and that means to fallback to using width property, yo!!
*The final `flex-basis` can't be higher than its max-width(or max-height when shooting vertically). If it is higher, the final flex-basis just becomes that max-value.
*The final `flex-basis` can't be lower than its min-width(or min-height when shooting vertically). If it is lower, the final flex-basis just becomes that min value.
*As a trick you can use (flex-direction: column/column-reverse) `max-height` to restrict maximum growing of an element of the flex, yikes!!(Similarly with width if flex-direction is either row or row-reverse).
* flex-basis is a hypothetical size before any growing or shrinking begins.
/////////////////
ORDER, DEFAULT order's value is zero.
* The bigger the order, the farther it'll be in the lazer's direction.
* The elements in the flex are ordered according to the order, i.e., lower first, higher last.
/////////////////
‚ù§Ô∏èFLEX-WRAP
nowrap (default)

This property is given to the crossbow itself.
When elements in the flex wrap into new line if space is not enough, we need
`flex-wrap: wrap`. These lines are always parallel to flex-direction.
* To make new line above current line, use `flex-wrap-wrap-reverse;`
*LEARN: When we use `wrap-reverse`, align-items:flex-start will make its first-line at  bottom(in case of flex-direction row/row-reverse). *Also align-items:flex-start will make its first-line at in top (in case of flex-direction as column/column-reverse), check if thats a little wrong typed :( :LOL:
* flex-wrap: wrap-reverse makes the align-items: flex-end to go to the top instead of the bottom like it normally would, even when nothing was wrapping!. Pretty crazy!
*  {flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: flex-end;} can act together to make the last child stick to the end of the flex, yo!!
*LEARN: The zombies(elements) treat the line they're on as the only space that matters. So they'll grow to fill up space on their line, and position themselves only within the boundaries of their line.
*LEARN: {flex-wrap}@crossbow and {flex-basis: 50%}@all_element_of_crossbow makes great ui as in two elements per line, yikes!
*LEARN: {align-items: flex-end; flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;flex-direction: column-reverse}@crossbow makes the elements align in right most line and add more items in line in the left direction only, yikes!
*LEARN: {justify-content: center, flex-wrap: wrap}@crossbow makes items in each line center justified, yikes, simple behaviour, yo!
*LEARN: flex-grow is still helpful with flex-wrap: wrap.
//////////////
‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄALIGN-CONTENT: It defines the alignment of lines (when `flex-wrap: wrap`) in  cross axis (direction perpendicular to main axis).
DEFAULT value of align-content is `stretch`. This property works in the perpendicular direction of the flex-direction.

stretch (default)	Lines stretch to fill the container
flex-start	Packs all lines to the start of the cross-axis
flex-end	Packs all lines to the end of the cross-axis
center	Centers all lines in the cross-axis
space-between	Evenly distributes lines, first and last lines at the edges
space-around	Even spacing around each line
space-evenly	Equal space between all lines, including edges

*LEARN: When shooting vertically, using {align-items: flex-end;} will make lines attracted towards right side.
*LEARN: What did I learn about `align-items`: When there gets too many zombies to fit in a single line and they start wrapping to new lines, those lines can be arranged in several different ways perpendicular to the direction I'm shooting, along the crossbow's blue Alignment Laser.

**AMAZING: mozilla's documentation for css is just awesome!! Check it out @ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container
 as live updating is there with evey character changed, yikes!!
/////////////////////////
// SHORTCUT/SHORTHAND:
`flex: 1 1 300px`
This is applicable to a child in flex, yo!! that means,`flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis` in that order. Acronym: grow-shrink-basis, gsb. Another e.g.,
`{flex: 10 auto;}`

// ANOTHER SHORTCUT/SHORTHAND:
LEARN: I can use flex to just specify flex-grow only if I want, and other property i.e., flex-shrink and flex-basis will be defined as shown below-
E.g.,
{flex:1}
will set
{
    flex-grow: 1;
    flex-shrink: 1;
    flex-basis: 0px; // Though this is different than flex-basis's default property i.e., auto, yo!
}, yo!!

// ANOTHER SHORTCUT/SHORTHAND:
{flex:auto} on element will set these properties..
{
    flex-grow: 1;
    flex-shrink:1;
    flex-basis: auto;
}

// ANOTHER SHORTCUT/SHORTHAND:
{flex: none} on element will set these properties..
{
    flex-grow: 0
    flex-shrink: 0
    flex-basis: auto
}, So using flex: auto means that we say listen zombie, don't grow, don't shrink, and just use your width as your basis.

// ANOTHER SHORTCUT/SHORTHAND:
flex-direction and flex-wrap
{flex-flow: column wrap;} on crossbow itself will set below properties..
{
    flex-direction: column;
    flex-wrap: wrap
}
```
