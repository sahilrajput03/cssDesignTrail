# Flexbox Zombies Course Notes

## Video 1: `display: flex`

- Flexbox Zombies Game: [Click here](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/)

<ins>**Note: The headings below contain key-value pairs that represent their default values.**</ins>

### `flex-direction: row`

This defines the main axis of flex container. We can apply following values to flex-direction property: `row` (default), `row-reverse`, `column-reverse` and `column`.

### `justify-content: flex-start`

It defines alignment of children of flex in main axis. We can use following values: `flex-start` (default), `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around `(in this case space will be in the end of each sides too)

### `align-items: stretch` (parent) and `align-self: stretch` (children)

<ins>Ô∏èNote: When `align-items` is set parent, its children use that value as the default for their `align-self` property.</ins>

- `align-items` is assigned to the cross bow itself.
- `align-items` defines the alignment in cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis).
- `align-self` is assigned to children elements.

We can apply following values for both `align-items` and `align-self`:

- `stretch` (default), `center`, `flex-start`, `flex-end` and `baseline`. <ins>(`baseline` is helpful if you have different font-size elements, and you want them to have their lower bottom of line aligned. ([video example](https://youtu.be/hwbqquXww-U?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjMSb9c06AjRlTpvxL3otpUd&t=762))</ins>.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è `flex-wrap: nowrap` (parent)

<ins>Note: Using `align-content` is only useful when parent has `flex-wrap: wrap` else using `align-items` is suffice.</ins>

**Both of these properties (`flex-wrap` and `align-content`) are given to the crossbow itself. In flex container we might want the elements to wraps into multiple lines (literally referred as `lines` technically) which are parallel to main axis and we do that by applying `flex-wrap: wrap` to parent. This looks like:**

```txt
flex-direction: row;
flew-wrap: wrap;
1 2
3 4
```

You can assign `flex-wrap` values - `nowrap` (default) and `wrap`.

Other helpful combination example values:

```text
flex-direction: row;
flew-wrap: wrap-reverse;
3 4
1 2

flex-direction: row-reverse;
flew-wrap: wrap;
2 1
4 3

flex-direction: row-reverse;
flew-wrap: wrap-reverse;
4 3
2 1
```

<ins>**‚ö†Ô∏èNote: `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` with `align-items: flex-end` makes items go to the top instead of the bottom like it normally would, even when nothing is wrapping!. Pretty crazy! üöÄ TAKE AWAY: When you using `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` the align-items's `flex-start` and `flex-end` behaves as it they were reversed.**</ins>

```text
*  Tip: With `flex-wrap: wrap;` you can use `justify-content: flex-end;` to make the childdren stick to the end of the flex.

* ‚úÖNote:
flex-direction: column-reverse;
align-items: flex-end;
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
Using above css makes the elements align in right most line. That looks like as shown below. (In below figure . represents empty space due to alignment specified via `align-items: flex-end`):

. 4 2
. 3 1
```

- A commonly used pattern to make content center justified. In below figure . represents empty spaces due to specified alignment via `justify-content: center`:

```txt
flex-direction: row;
justify-content: center;
flex-wrap: wrap;

. 1 2 .
. 3 4 .
```

**üöÄTips:**

- `flex-wrap:wrap` parent and `flex-basis: 50%` on all children places two child per line.
- `flex-grow` is still helpful with `flex-wrap: wrap`.

## `align-content: stretch` (parent)

‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄ`align-content`: It defines the alignment of lines itself in cross axis (direction perpendicular to main axis).

_Note: `align-content` requires that `flex-wrap: wrap` is set on parent._

<ins>Note: The lines stretch to fill the container because `align-content: stretch` is the default value.</ins>

We can assign it following values:

```
stretch (default)	  Lines stretch to fill the container
flex-start                Pull all lines to the start of the cross-axis
flex-end	          Throws all lines to the end of the cross-axis
center	                  Centers all lines in the cross-axis
space-between	          Evenly distributes lines, first and last lines at the edges
space-around	          Even spacing around each line
space-evenly	          Equal space between all lines, including edges
```

**‚ù§Ô∏è Relation of `align-content` with `align-items`:**

`align-content` vs. `align-items` (ChatGPT): [Click here](https://chatgpt.com/c/67f6d4f6-3cf0-8007-b0ef-0c38a8031de1)

üöÄüöÄüöÄ `align-content` must be set to its default value (`stretch`) if we want `align items` property to work. If `align-content` is not set to its default value `stretch` then setting any value to `align-items` property doesn't work at all. [TESTED] üöÄüöÄüöÄ

‚úÖLEARN: When `flex-direction: column`, using `align-content: flex-end;` will make lines pulled towards right side.

## Video 2: `flex-grow: 0` (child) and `flex-shrink: 1` (child)

**Apply `flex-grow` to children (not to the crossbow itself) to make them auto expand according to space available in main axis.**

‚ù§Ô∏èThe default value `flex-grow: 0` makes items to not auto expand at all.

```txt
* If you want children to grow such that 1st element and 2nd element in proportion 1:2 then we can do:
flex-grow: 1; (on 1st child:)
flex-grow: 2; (on 2nd child:)
```

**Apply `flex-shrink` to children (not to crossbow itself) to make them auto compress (shrink) in main axis. The default value is `flex-shrink: 1` (default).**

_‚ù§Ô∏èAmazing demonstration @ [Click here](https://youtu.be/o-dDFSH-BxM)._

- LEARN: Setting `flex-shrink: 2` to a child will make that particular child to shrink twice as other items because other items have 1 as their value by default.
- If you give same value of `flex-shrink` (ITS ABOUT RATIOS ONLY) to all children of the flex then its just same as `1:1:1...` and so on --- then all children shrinks at same rate because the raio is same.
- LEARN: You can make a particular child to refuse to shrink by setting `flex-shrink: 0` (which is default value of `flex-shrink`).

## `flex-basis: auto` (child) [fallback to `width`/`height` property]

**Apply `flex-basis` to children (not to the crossbow itself). The default value `flex-basis: auto` means to fallback to using `width` when `flex-direction: row` or `height` property when `flex-direction: column`. `flex-basis` changes the size of items in the direction of main axis. Example: `flex-basis: 300px`, `flex-basis: 50vw`.**

- ‚ù§Ô∏è `flex-basis` defines the starting size of a flex item before any space is distributed by flex-grow or taken away by flex-shrink.
  - Think of it as the initial width or height (depending on flex direction) that the item ‚Äúwants‚Äù to be.
- `flex-basis` overrides (takes precedence) the `width` property when `flex-direction: row`.
- `flex-basis` overrides (takes precedence) the `height` property when `flex-direction: column`.
  - It is a new and improved version of css width/height property.
  - `flex-basis` is a hypothetical size before any growing or shrinking begins.

```txt
Also, in below e.g.,
.goo{
    width: 500px;
    flex-basis: 100px; // ‚úÖ Here, flex-basis takes precedence over width property.
}
```

<ins>**Points to Remember when using `flex-basis`:**</ins>

1. `min-width` and `max-width` also applies to `flex-basis` in the same way as they work with `width` property to restrict the minimum shrinking and maximum growing value in main axis.
   a. And vice-versa for `min-height` and `max-height` when `flex-direction: column`.
2. ‚ù§Ô∏è `flex-basis` can be used to set percentage (of total size of the flex container) to set its width (height when `flex-direction: column`) --- just like we use percentage values with `width`/`height` properties.
   a. For e.g., if we set `flex-basis: 50%` to one item in a flex then that item takes 50% of the width of the flex container (considering `flex-direction: row`).

## `order: 0` (child)

**Apply `order` to children (not to the crossbow itself). The default value is `order: 0`. It can have negative values too which makes them appear at the start.**

- The elements in the flex are ordered according to the order, i.e., lower first, higher last.

## üöÄSHORTHAND - `flex: 0 1 auto` (child) shorthand for `flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis`

Docs @ mdn: [Click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex)

- `flex: 1` on a child makes the child to expand to take up equal space with other `flex: 1` items in the same container.

```css
flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 0%;
```

```html
<div style="display: flex;">
  <div style="flex: 1; background: red;">A</div>
  <div style="flex: 1; background: blue;">B</div>
</div>
```

- `flex: 2` on a child will make the child to take twice as much available space as an child with `flex: 1`.

```css
flex-grow: 2;
flex-shrink: 1; // (sets to default)
flex-basis: 0%; // Note: This is different than flex-basis's default property (`auto`)
```

- `flex: auto` on a child makes the child flexible (can grow and shrink), but starts with its natural size (like content or set width).

```css
flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 1; // (sets to default)
flex-basis: auto;
```

- `flex: none` means the elemen won‚Äôt grow, won‚Äôt shrink, and will keep its original size (defined by width/height or content):

```css
flex-grow: 0;
flex-shrink: 0;
flex-basis: auto;
```

- `flex: 10 auto` on a child makes the chid can grow a lot, and will take 10 units of available space compared to others. It can shrink if needed.

```css
flex-grow: 10;
flex-shrink: 1; // (sets to default)
flex-basis: auto;
```

- `flex: 1 1 300px` on a child makes the child to grow and shrink equally as any other child having `flex-grow: 1` and `flex-shrink: 1`.

```css
flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 300px;
```

## üöÄSHORTHAND - `flex-flow: row nowrap` (parent)

**It is a shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.**

- `flex-flow` to specify `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` for shorthand on the crossbow itself. Example: : `flex-flow: column wrap` will result into:

```css
flex-direction: column;
flex-wrap: wrap;
```

Thanks.
